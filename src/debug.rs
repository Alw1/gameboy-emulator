//Module for printing debug info

/*
TODO LIST:

- Find an ncurses like library to handle the debug screen
- Implement terminal readout for real time CPU register terminal printout
- Maybe allow for debug to enter instructions manually one by one
- Add more debug modules as I finish more aspects of the system
